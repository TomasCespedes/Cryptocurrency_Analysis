# Cryptocurrency_Analysis

## Goal
The goal of this project was to see if using 540 days worth of data for 9 seperate cryptocurrencies if we can predict whether or not within a day will provide us with an increase or decrease in price from the previous day. I ran three seperate analysis methods on our data which were Market Basket Analysis, Support Vector Machines, and Decision Trees.

## Getting Started
In order to utilize Market Basket Analysis and have a response as to whether or not the price will increase (0 or 1), we need to manipulate the data to fit a transaction cart dataset. The SYEFinalProjectDataPrime file goes through each data set and adds a new variable called "inBasket". If the price of the day we are looking at ended up higher than the previous day than it is coded as a 1, otherwise it is a 0. After this was done, a whole new data set was created with all 9 inBasket variables which is our transaction cart dataset. Once that had been done, I went through the transcation cart dataset and replaced the 1s with the name of the actual coin (so that we know which coin is in the cart for the day), otherwise, it was left blank. Once we have all the variables the way we want them, we then save the new dataset as a csv file to be analyzed. 

## Market Basket Analysis
The goal of market basket is to try and predict whether if certain items are in a "shopping cart", they will increase the probability of a specific item to also show up in the shopping cart. In my analysis, I wanted to see if an increase of price of some collection of coins would have a correlation to a specific coin increasing. For example, if Bitcoin, Neo, and Vertcoin go up, maybe we will see an increase in VeChain as well. Since there is no train/test option for Market basket, I ran the algorithm on the entire dataset, a random first half of the dataset, and the random second half of the dataset and compared results across all three outputs. Below you can see the output of run on the entire dataset as an example.

 The parameter we care most about is the Lift. If the lift is equal to 1, that means that there is no correlation between the items. However, if the lift is greater than 1, that means the items in the basket (the collection of items to the left) increase the likelihood of the item on the right. The higher the lift, the higher the correlation. The output is ordered by highest lift. Based on our results, that means that Cardano has the highest likelihood of increasing based on the increase in price of other coins. While Cardano appears the most at first, we do start to see other coins such as EOS and Ethereum appear. 
 
 ## Support Vector Machines
 In theory, the objective of SVM is to maximize the distance of a line between two groups of points (in this case whether the price will increase or decrease) to see if we can classify points based on where they will fall on a graph. Since we have 9 datasets, I split each dataset into a train (random 75% of data) and test set so that we can test (remaining 25% of our data) our misclassification set out of sample to get more accurate results. At the end of the training, I was left with 9 models to test since each model is specific to the cryptocurrency rather than having 1 model for 9 datasets. I tuned each model with costs {0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 5, 10, 100} as well as changing the kernel to see which had the lowest misclassification rate.
